  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The course project is an opportunity for you to apply what you have learned in class and to explore the frontiers in GenAI.
    Potential projects may fall into these categories:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Methods.</strong>
      Propose some novel methods, models or algorithms that improve the existing ones under some setting.
      Think of diffusion transformers vs. U-Net-based diffusion models, for instance.
    <li>
      <strong>Applications.</strong>
      If you're coming to the class with a specific background and interests (e.g. biology,
      engineering, physics), we'd love to see you apply GenAI models to problems related to your
      particular domain of interest.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Abalation studies / engineering recipes.</strong>
      Many methods that work in practice include many hyperparameters and design choices.
      How do different choices of them make a difference, and why?
      How should other practioners pick the them to save time?
      You may do some ablation studies to demonstrate your empirical observations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Theory (not very recommended).</strong>
      You may show some interesting theoretical aspects (generalization bounds, theoretical gaps of some approximations, etc.).
      We do expect theoretical work be done individually. Double check with us if you decide to work on theory.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  We have compiled a list of <a href="#proj_ideas">project ideas for inspiration</a>. Note that you <b>do not</b> need to pick one from here. Rather, these can be served as starting points for you to find the ideas that excite you.
  </p>
  <p>
    To inspire ideas, you might also look at recent deep learning publications from top-tier
    conferences or course projects from renowned universities.
  </p>

</div>

<div class="container sec" id="collaboration" style="margin-top:-50px">
  <br>
  <h2>Collaboration</h2>
  <p>
    You can work in teams of up to <strong>4</strong> people (but only 1 if you end up working on theory or write a survey).
    We do expect that projects done with
    4 people have more impressive writeup and results than projects done with fewer people. For example, to get a
    sense for the scope and expectations for projects, have a look at project reports from
    previous years. While we encourage that you work in teams, you may also work alone.
  </p>

  <h2>Honor Code</h2>
  <p>
    You may consult any papers, books, online references, or publicly available implementations for
    ideas and code that you may want to incorporate into your strategy or algorithm, so long as you
    clearly cite your sources in your code and your writeup. However, under no circumstances may you
    look at another group's code or incorporate their code into your project.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are combining your course project with another ongoing course project or research project, you DO NOT need to receive prior permission.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="container sec" id="proposal" style="margin-top:-50px">
  <br>
  <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
  <p>
    The project proposal should be one paragraph (200-400 words). Your project proposal should
    describe:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the problem that you will be investigating? Why is it interesting?</li>
    <li>What reading will you examine to provide context and background?</li>
    <li>If you do experiments: what data will you use?</li>
    <li>
      What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations, will you
      use them and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations? You don't have
      to have an exact answer at this point, but you should have a general sense of how you will
      approach the problem you are working on.
    </li>
    <li>
      How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g.
      plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or
      compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?
    </li>
    <li>
     If you are combining this project with another course/research project, what is the unique portion of the project that is counted towards this class?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>Submission:</b>
    Please submit your proposal as a PDF. <b>Only one person on your team should submit.</b>
    Please have this person add the rest of your team as collaborators as a "Group Submission".
  </p>
</div>

<div class="container sec" id="milestone" style="margin-top:-50px">
  <br>
  <h2>Project Milestone</h2>
  It is NOT required to submit a project milestone report. However, we do encourage teams to submit one by March 20 as an internal deadline.
  I will be relatively lenient in grading the final report if the team submit their milestone report.
  <br>
  Your project milestone report should be between 2 - 3 pages using the
  <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NeurIPS template</a>
  or the <a href="https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2024.zip">ICLR template</a>.
  <br>
  The following is a suggested structure for your report:
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Title, Author(s)</li>
      <li>Introduction: this section introduces your problem, and the overall plan for approaching your problem</li>
      <li>Problem statement: Describe your problem precisely specifying the dataset to be used, expected results and evaluation</li>
      <li>Technical Approach: Describe the methods you intend to apply to solve the given problem</li>
      <li>
      Intermediate/Preliminary Results: State and evaluate your results upto the milestone
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Submission</strong>
    Please submit your milestone as a PDF. <b>Only one person on your team should submit.</b>
    Please have this person add the rest of your team as collaborators as a "Group Submission".
  </p>
</div>

<div class="container sec" id="report" style="margin-top:-50px">
  <br>
  <h2>Final Report</h2>
  <p>
    Your final write-up is required to be between <b>4 - 8</b> pages using the
    <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NeurIPS template</a>
    or the <a href="https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2024.zip">ICLR template</a>,
    structured like a paper from a machine learning / computer vision / natural language processing conference.
    Please use this template so we can fairly judge all student projects without worrying about
    altered font sizes, margins, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following is a suggested structure for your report, as well as the rubric that we will
    follow when evaluating reports. You don't necessarily have to organize your report using
    these sections in this order, but that would likely be a good starting point for most projects.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Title, Author(s)</b></li>
    <li>
      <b>Abstract.</b> Briefly describe your problem, approach, and key results. Should be no more
      than 300 words.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Introduction.</b>
      Describe the problem you are working on, why it's important, and an overview of your results
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Related Work.</b>
      Discuss published work that relates to your project. How is your approach similar or different
      from others?
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Methods.</b>
      Discuss your approach for solving the problems that you set up in the introduction. Why is
      your approach the right thing to do? Did you consider alternative approaches? You should
      demonstrate that you have applied ideas and skills built up during the quarter to tackling
      your problem of choice. It may be helpful to include figures, diagrams, or tables to
      describe your method or compare it with other methods.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Experiments (not necessary for theoretical papers).</b>
      Discuss the experiments that you performed to demonstrate that your approach solves the
      problem. The exact experiments will vary depending on the project, but you might compare
      with previously published methods, perform an ablation study to determine the impact of
      various components of your system, experiment with different hyperparameters or architectural
      choices, use visualization techniques to gain insight into how your model works, discuss
      common failure modes of your model, etc. You should include graphs, tables, or other figures
      to illustrate your experimental results.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Conclusion.</b>
      Summarize your key results - what have you learned? Suggest ideas for future extensions
      or new applications of your ideas.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Appendix and/or Supplementary Materials (optional).</b>
      If you would like to share more related but less relevant stuff.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>Submission.</b>
    You will submit your final report as a PDF and your supplementary material as a separate PDF
    or ZIP file.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Additional Submission Requirements.</b>
    We will also ask you do do the following when you submit your project report:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Your report PDF should list <i>all</i> authors who have contributed to your work; enough to
        warrant a co-authorship position.</b> This includes people not enrolled in this course such as
      faculty/advisors if they sponsored your work with funding or data, significant mentors (e.g.,
      PhD students or postdocs who coded with you, collected data with you, or helped draft your
      model on a whiteboard). All authors should be listed directly underneath the title on your PDF.
      Include a footnote on the first page indicating which authors are not enrolled in this course. All
      co-authors should have their institutional/organizational affiliation specified below the title.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Any code that was used as a base for projects must be referenced and cited in the body of the paper.</b>
      This includes assignment codes, finetuning example codes, open-source, or Github
      implementations. You can use a footnote or full reference/bibliography entry.
    </li>
  </ul>
